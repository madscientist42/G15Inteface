G15Inteface
===========

WIP of a re-spin of G15Tools using HIDAPI instead of libusb.

This is a Work In Progress of a project to produce a G15Tools-ng (or rather the 
basis for that and a bit more...).

It is *NOT* intended to be a drop-in replacement of the G15Tools, the included 
lib, or any of that.  It's a functional re-work of the whole thing with an eye
on being quite a bit more sophisticated (The original was a bit dumb in that it
only worked with the first device found and you were done.  If you have a Z10
speaker set, you didn't get it to work or your nifty G510s or G13 wouldn't work
right.  Not really acceptable.  Right now, it's framed in to be able to list
and provide control support for multiple devices on the machine in question.

What works:

- Macro Record/Selection LEDs
- Macro Record/Selection button detection
- Backlight brightness on a G15.
- RGB color selection on a G13 or G510s
- LCD bitmap setting on any G15 class "gamepad" including G13, G15v1, G15v2, 
  and G510s
  
What doesn't work (Yet- it *IS* a WIP...):

- Keymappings on anything other than the G510s (And they only partially work 
  on the G510s)
- *ANY* of the G19 support- this will probably be done as a separate little
  beastie from this (i.e. I'll refactor this one a bit and make a more 
  generic interface than this that provides a common edge to work with,
  etc...)
- Keeping the Key events from reaching the input edge without this lib's
  say-so (If you're controlling the G15/G510s, you don't want the keyboard
  events from the G-keys (Which do come out against /dev/input, etc.) going
  out to everything.  You want to intercept them and hand them out as read
  G-keys, be able to intercept the keystrokes as normal mapped key-events
  so you can do key-macro recording with a daemon upstream of this, etc.)

This is being exposed in Git with an intent of publishing early and often.  
It *currently* is not really intended for general public consumption- but 
is up for me being able to have multiple backups of the work and history 
and to allow someone that is a dev to scoop it up and extend it (Hey, if you 
like where I'm taking this and you beat me to the punch in finishing part 
or all of the functionality that doesn't work- knock yourself out.  It'll 
get it all done that much sooner- and this is just the beginning of something
that is a real solution to a real problem (though a small one) on Linux
and it'll get us moved forward just that much faster doing it.)

Ultimately, this will be merged into a larger compliation that encompasses
this repo's contents and this will be deprecated.  The README will be
updated accordingly when that happens.
